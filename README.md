### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a full stack PHP developer however most of my repositories are not in PHP as the work I do is all in private repos.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a [tabletop gaming notes application](https://github.com/Olivia-Newberry/go-tabletop-companion-app) written in Go, Echo, Templ and TailwindCSS
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Go.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about any new technology or cyber security incident.
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: She/Her
- âš¡ Fun fact: There are more JS frameworks than there are breeds of dogs.
